FWIW, There\u0027s VERY good reasons to enable it if you want to accept new configs on the fly securely, but doing that caused people that hadn\u0027t upstreamed their schemas to break, so.......  we do what\u0027s best for the greater industry.\n\nThat\u0027s fine if you don\u0027t want to test the enabled option, I just want something I can point people to when they scream about schemas not being enforced or EM crashing.",
