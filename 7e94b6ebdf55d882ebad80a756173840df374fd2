Ideally the schema would prevent loading a hysteresis value on the sensors that don\u0027t support it (unless you intend on adding dbus-sensors support for it, in which case it\u0027s moot).\n\nGiven the schema files are still a little bit disingenuous, so i\u0027m probably ok with imperfect enforcement of schema, but I\u0027d at least like to understand what to expect.",

Giving a dbus-sensors app a config with a hysteresis and seeing that it doesn\u0027t error out? \n\nGood: it would error out, because you gave it a value it didn\u0027t allow in the config.  \nBetter: It would catch this at compile time because of it not being allowed in the schema.\nBest: Dbus-sensors just supported setting hyseresis.\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong opinion here on how far to go, I\u0027m happy to accept things as-is, but I want to understand the behavior, and make sure we\u0027re not causing a crash or something worse by allowing this schema change through for sensors that don\u0027t support it.\n\n\n\u003e \n\u003e From the looks of parseThresholdConfig() in dbus-sensors the Hysteresis field if supplied will be ignored.
