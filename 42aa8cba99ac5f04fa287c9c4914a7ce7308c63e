      "message": "Should we have some level of checking that the FRU we\u0027re restoring matches the device we\u0027re restoring to?  Imagine the case:\n1. Back up add in card A at bus 1 address 1.\n2. Add in card A is swapped with a different card B. (also could have i2c bus 1 replaced with bus 2 on a reboot)\n3. User calls \"restore\"\n\nIn that case, the serial number from card A is implanted on card B.  There\u0027s almost no case where we want this to happen, and would cause a lot of problems for both inventory management and device manufacturers if the serial number is a duplicate.  Is this a case you\u0027ve thought of?  Should we have at least some minor protection against this.  Maybe verify the serial number is the same?",

It is not impossible for someone to find that out, but fairly inconvenient. For that reason, a restore functionality exists, and based on how fru-device operates, it sits on dbus. Also, is dbus considered a user-facing interface, strictly speaking? \n\n\u003e I\u0027ve seen this same function exist on many systems, just not directly in the bmc.
