      "message": "The adm1275 driver (which also handles the adm1293) is a hwmon driver, so that one certainly appears to make sense.\n\nI\u0027m slightly confused about our ina219 support though -- grepping the dbus-sensors tree it looks like that device is handled by the psusensor daemon, which I had thought was intended to handle pmbus devices (which from its datasheet it doesn\u0027t appear to be).  Looking at the kernel tree, I see both a non-pmbus hwmon driver (drivers/hwmon/ina2xx.c) and an IIO driver (drivers/iio/adc/ina2xx-adc.c), both of which have \"ti,ina219\" in their of_device_id tables and \"ina219\" in their i2c_device_id tables (Kconfig indicates that they\u0027re mutually exclusive).  Given the change in this patch I assume it\u0027s meant to be used with the former, though I suppose there\u0027s also the iio-hwmon \"adapter\" driver which could potentially be in play?\n\nAnyway, upshot is that I don\u0027t see a problem with it, I\u0027m just kind of curious (a) which driver this is meant to be used with in openbmc, and (b) why/how psusensor is apparently handling non-pmbus devices.",

      "message": "Hi Zev, \n\nThe ina2xx driver I\u0027m intending to use is the one in drivers/hwmon/ina2xx.c.\n\nFor point (b), I\u0027m not very familiar with the history of dbus-sensors or the psusensor class, but it seems like a catch-all for all other hwmon drivers that don\u0027t fit into the other, more specific classes of sensors.  I don\u0027t see anything baked into psusensor that would require something to be a pmbus device - except maybe the pmbusNames struct but it looks like the name may have been ignored :)",
