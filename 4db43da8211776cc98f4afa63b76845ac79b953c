What do you think 😊\n\n## concern about developer workflow (introspecting)\n\nWith the alternative code path, it would not be as easy anymore for folks to dump some logs of ```busctl introspect``` to show all the interfaces and values without relying on the existing code path. Since there would be multiple object paths needed to dump the information.\n\nBut that can be solved by having some small helper program to dump the subtree  and it\u0027s dbus interfaces without the \n```\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Peer\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n```\nwhich seems to be on all the object paths.\n\nWould you like to have such a helper program created to make the workflow easier?\n\n## concern about performance (daemon consuming the config)\n\nWhen using the new API, there may be more DBus calls required than before.\nSince the information is found on different object paths instead of one.\n\nI would not be too concerned since the configuration may not change that often.\n\n## concern about performance (EM)\n\nWould you like to see some benchmarks here? We could insert some timestamp logging into EM at debug level to make it easier to look at the impacts of changes like that.",
