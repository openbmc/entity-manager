My system has LANG\u003den_US.utf8 and resulted in a different sorting.\n\nI tried to search around the organization for other cases where we add LANG.  The only ones I found were in openbmc-build-scripts where we also set to `en_US.utf8`.  I\u0027m fine using that here as well but it means that the current generated file will have some changes.\n\nOpinions?",
