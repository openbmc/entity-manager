      "message": "I\u0027m ok with this, but these naming schemes are Meta specified but the components are off-the-shelf devices.  We might not be able to change the sensor names like this.\n\nAlexander was potentially working on a method to overwrite common-device configs on a per-machine basis, which could be leveraged in the future.  Until that is in, unless this naming change is acceptable upstream, we might need to keep these as a patch downstream.",

Config record includes were meant to cover the use-case for board variants, but renaming a sensor is not a hardware variant. It would be possible but there might be pushback.\n\nAlternatively, Meta could propose a naming scheme for sensor names and document it in EM repo?\n\n@ed@tanous.net @spinler@us.ibm.com Do you have any input on the sensor names?\n\nhttps://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2049_0.2.2b.pdf\n\ncould be used as the starting point since it already defines some sensor names from the redfish side.",
