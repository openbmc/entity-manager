      "message": "I don\u0027t think so, at least not currently.\n\nThe comparisons are not equivalent. In `entity-manager`\u0027s power status monitor (`power_status_monitor.cpp`), the check is:\n\n```\n        powerStatusOn \u003d\n            std::get\u003cstd::string\u003e(findState-\u003esecond).ends_with(\"Running\");\n```\n\nThis means both `TransitioningToRunning` and `Running` are interpreted as power-on states. If we reuse this logic, it will result in double scans during each host power-on ‚Äî one when in `TransitioningToRunning` and another when in `Running` state.\n\nTherefore, it seems safer to keep this logic separate for now. \n\nAlso, see this commit: https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/commit/3b13fb4b7f6b3dee5db2966b444d61c11f84153a",

We can use the same power status monitor and store the complete value of `CurrentHostState` internally.\n\nThen provide 2 different methods to access them something like this:\n\n```\nbool isPowerOn() // currently used in EM\nbool isPowerOnComplete() // require exactly \"xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host.HostState.Running\"\n```",
