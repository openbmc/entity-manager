I\u0027m not sure if this is a complex enough change to full-on require a design document to be approved, though.\n\nI suspect the in-source comment could be simplified to treat this as a done-deal, then cut/paste any justifications/points for discussion into a gerrit comment, or in-line gerrit comment for any further discussion needed.\n\n(That said, I don\u0027t know enough about operations being done in the 2nd half of this commit to have any complaints about them, and the top half looks good to me :)",
