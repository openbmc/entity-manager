      "message": "Ideally it should _only_ be a number, but due to the way any \"$bus\"-like statements are in the EM config, you have to have string for nearly everything.  I think it gets converted back to a number for dbus though.\n\nI looked at a device that had an instance of `clemente_scm.json` and the Configuration.EEPROM had both `t` as the type for Address and Bus, when I do a `busctl introspect`.  But, in legacy.json, Address is defined as just `string` and Bus is `[string, number]`",
