Can you please compare and contrast why the existing functionality doesn\u0027t meet your needs?\n\nAlso, read-margin-temp is in meta-quanta, and already claims to accomplish this same feature, although is not EM enabled.  Could you please compare that as well?",

      "message": "It can meet my needs。\n\nMy biggest requirement is that the ipmitool sensor list only displays one NVMe sensor per zone.\n\nI think the ipmitool sensor list is determined by xxx-ipmi-sensors.yaml.\n\nIn EM, all sensors need to be configured, because EM decides whether to read from physical devices.Therefore, 24 hard disks and 2 maximum values need to be both configured in entity-manager/baseboard.json。\n\nThe phosphor-virtual-sensor can also be configured with multiple temperature sensors to obtain the maximum value. The configuration in entity-manager is mainly because Threshold can be managed in the same place. For example, save to a file or restore the default value.\n\n\nIf want to know all nvme temperatures,may need to call the methods in dbus-sensors instead of ipmitool。",
