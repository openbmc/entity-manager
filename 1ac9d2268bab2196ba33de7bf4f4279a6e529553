      "message": "PID loops already support this.  Adding multiple sensors to the Inputs array, will take the max of each of them.  Can you please compare and contrast why the existing functionality doesn\u0027t meet your needs?\n\nAlso, read-margin-temp is in meta-quanta, and already claims to accomplish this same feature, although is not EM enabled.  Could you please compare that as well?",

Also, FWIW, most implementations I\u0027m aware of DO want to know all nvme temperatures, given that they will be applied to different zones.",
