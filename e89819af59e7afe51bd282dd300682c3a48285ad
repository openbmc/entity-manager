      "message": "I commented this elsewhere, but this function has been re-engineered and modified so many times, in so many different forks, that I\u0027d like to keep a representation of the \"old way\" and just have modes we can run this in.\n\nIt seems like every time we modify this function, we break someone in some unknown way.  I realize this is directly enumerating hardware, and all hardware acts differently, so aside from being able to set the old behavior, I don\u0027t know how we test changes like this.\n\nLets add a meson option for \"16 bit detect mode\", and give the modes names of 1, 2, 3, then in code, we can document how each detect mode operates.",
