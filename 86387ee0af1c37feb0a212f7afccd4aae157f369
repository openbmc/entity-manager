I want to first extract a basic schema from ```Aggregate``` so that the ```Aggregate``` schema will get smaller.\n\nThen we can have more specific schemas for different configurations.\n\nAs time goes on, these can be further refined. If there is any comment from people who have some knowledge of the dbus-sensors code, i can adjust ```required``` as needed.",
