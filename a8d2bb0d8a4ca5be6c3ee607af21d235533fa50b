      "message": "Looks like https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/82998 broke something (regex `$` removed at the end).\n\n@chaul@amperecomputing.com had another version of that patch (see PS6) which replaced syntax of `$bus` with `${bus}` which does not have the issue observed here.\n\nAnother benefit of that version of her patch was that the boundary of a template var is clearly defined so there is no conflict in case a template var is a prefix of another template var.\n\nThe sticking point seemed to be the format change https://discordapp.com/channels/775381525260664832/1402479981111676978/1415571530716549160\n\nMaybe the proposed fix can work for now but long-term it would be better to have something like `${...}` which ChauLy had initially and/or to go with some kind of parser which Ed had an old patch for.",
