While I still think using epoch everywhere would be more consistent, this patchset being far more non-trivial than I thought it would be, and the fact that we need 4 others to land correctly (Phosphor-dbus-interfaces, entity-manager, IBM, bmcweb) to realize that functionally is a reasonable argument that we shouldn\u0027t do it, or at the very least treat it as a separate problem to clean up later.\n\nI suspect this patchset can be radically simplified, to just make FRU device produce an ISO8160 string.",
