      "message": "This seems like one step too far.  Inventing a using definition that\u0027s longer than the original name, and obfuscates it.  Same thing with DBusInterfaceName, and DBusPath.  DBusPath is especially confusing, because sdbusplus already has a dbus path type, which isn\u0027t std::string, so IMO lets avoid the confusion and keep these down to one level of indirection.\n\nThe rest seems fine though.  FWIW I just finished getting the bmcweb versions of these in order, and I landed on vector\u003cpair\u003cstr, str\u003e\u003e being a better fit in these cases.  Not sure if this is the same or not",
