      "message": "While I was thinking about \"how would this work as a pure troubleshooting doc\" (re: questions you asked on Discord), it occurred to me that a lot of the troubleshooting I personally did wouldn\u0027t be needed on most platforms -- and several of those issues I had got resolved with daemon-level changes anyways.\n\nCurrently I\u0027m thinking about reframing this as a \"my_first_unsupported_sensor: a retrospective\" type doc that would be cleaned up with \"less is more\" -- as discussed on discord, but maybe retaining more of the existing structure the doc has now vs. what a true \"troubleshooting\" doc would be. \n\nIt would assume folks had already worked through the my_first_sensors doc, but maybe aren\u0027t sure to how to add something \u0027new\u0027 that no one else is using yet.\n\nWhat do folks think of approaching things from that angle?",
