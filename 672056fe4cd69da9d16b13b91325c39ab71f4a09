      "message": "\u003e For such a giant commit\n\nFeel free to only look at the implementation for now, then it will be less code to review.\n\nI can then split the patch once the implementation is ready to merge, but would prefer to keep it one patch for the first few revisions.\n\nLet me know what works best for you üëç.\n\n\u003e , I feel like more than a 3 sentence commit message is needed. \n\nGood point, added a github permalink to the design aswell, in case the gerrit link will be invalid in the future.\n\nAlso added a small summary of the feature to the commit message.\n\nAlso adjusted the README.md to contain some configuration example and small explanation.\nWe can go from there and see if anything needs to be added/removed.",
