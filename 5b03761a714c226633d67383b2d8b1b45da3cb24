      "message": "The internal tooling uses the Chassis.Type to identify whether the FRU is \"SERVER\" or \"CHASSIS\", and the current rule is \"Blade\"-\u003e\"SERVER\", \"RackMount\"-\u003e\"CHASSIS\" because this rule is designed using yv4 multi-host system as the sample. I double check the description for [\"Blade\"](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Item/Chassis.interface.yaml#L16-L20) and it does seem that it doesn\u0027t fit for single host case. To prevent such conflict,  I guess one way to solve this is to have the internal tooling taking single/multi-host as a factor when deciding the FRU type and so we can use \"RackMount\" here. Or we should actually change the mapping to \"Blade/RackMount\"-\u003e\"SERVER\", \"Enclosure\"-\u003e\"Chassis\" and do some change on the yv4 part? (The description seems to indicate that [\"RackMount\"](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Item/Chassis.interface.yaml#L33-L36) is for single-host chassis)",
