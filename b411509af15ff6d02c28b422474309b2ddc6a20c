      "message": "Initially it was not a shared pointer, i made it a shared pointer based on feedback\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/84123/comment/702f91e9_fb2b3786/\n\nFrom what i remember the concern there was local reasoning. If we pass in a reference to FruDevice into some function, the lifetime is not known when looking only at that one function. So if we want to use that reference later as part of a callback or something then it would have to be passed in as shared_ptr.\n\nSo even if we know (from global reasoning) about the lifetime of FruDevice instance, we cannot use that information since it is preferred to be able to understand/review a single function separately.\n\nEven though the inline lambda for `ReScan` is technically a separate function, the reader is still inside `main` function. So we can use local reasoning and see that the FruDevice instance is in scope from line 1328 until the end of `main` function.\n\nSo from my perspective it is fine to leave it like this for now, unless someone has a strong opinion here. Do you think it should be changed?",
