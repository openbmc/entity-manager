It\u0027s not uncommon that I go looking for examples of E-M parameter usage in existing configs via something lazy like `less $(git grep -l foo configurations)`, which of course gets tripped up if it hits anything with a space in it.",

      "message": "My two half-baked thoughts were:\n\n1. Segregate configurations into vendor-specific directories, no spaces in config names: ibm/Storm_King.json\n\nor\n\n2. Use devicetree-compatible-like file names, e.g. ibm,storm-king.json\n\n2 pushes people towards more consistency (file name has a crude grammar, all lower case, dashes) though might become unwieldy with lots of configs (though no more than what we currently have). 1 gives less consistency than 2 without further rules around capitalisation and dash-vs-underscore, but would help alleviate the lots-of-configs-in-one-directory (future) problem.",
