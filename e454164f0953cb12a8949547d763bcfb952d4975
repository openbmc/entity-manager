On the one hand, the patchset itself seems reasonable to come up with a standard;  On the other hand, if having spaces is causing issues in practical code, it means that we\u0027re not escaping something properly.\n\nIn terms of tradeoffs, I\u0027m probably ok with this, I just want to give it a little more thought.",

It\u0027s not uncommon that I go looking for examples of E-M parameter usage in existing configs via something lazy like `less $(git grep -l foo configurations)`, which of course gets tripped up if it hits anything with a space in it.",
