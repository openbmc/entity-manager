      "message": "Apologies for having been misleading in prior discussions.\n\nI just read up about the difference between size_t and off_t: \"size_t is part of the C++ (and C) standards, and refers to the type of a sizeof expression. off_t is defined by the Posix standard, and refers to the size of a file.\" and \"off_t is signed whereas size_t is unsigned\" (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10634629/what-are-the-usage-differences-between-size-t-and-off-t).\n\nAssuming this is true, I wonder if using size_t for both \"address\" and \"offset\" is really what we should be using? I noticed that there are a few \"uint8_t address\" declarations, which I assume relate to the i2c-device-address, but I\u0027d say that all declarions of \"uint16_t address\" and \"uint16_t offset\" should really be size_t.\n\nThoughts?",
