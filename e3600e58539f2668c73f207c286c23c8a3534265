Also, what if we want to use offset reader AND Caching reader (which seems likely for something like tyan)  the global offset stuff probably deserves to be a primitive within FruReader, instead of a wrapper class?",

      "message": "We\u0027d normally use std::visit for this kind of thing, to avoid the case where someone adds a new variant type, but forgets to add a case statement here.  With that said, I\u0027d really like to see offset reader not be variant based, and just use a switch statement.  There\u0027s only one function we\u0027re switching on here, maybe there\u0027s a good reason for the variant I\u0027m not seeing?",
