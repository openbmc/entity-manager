      "message": "can we just implement this as a simple switch?  std::visit seems like kind of overkill for this.  Also, what if we want to use offset reader AND Caching reader (which seems likely for something like tyan)  the global offset stuff probably deserves to be a primitive within FruReader, instead of a wrapper class?",

      "message": "We\u0027d normally use std::visit for this kind of thing, to avoid the case where someone adds a new variant type, but forgets to add a case statement here.  With that said, I\u0027d really like to see offset reader not be variant based, and just use a switch statement.  There\u0027s only one function we\u0027re switching on here, maybe there\u0027s a good reason for the variant I\u0027m not seeing?",
