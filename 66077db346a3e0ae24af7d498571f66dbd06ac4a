      "message": "From an entity-manager JSON point of view, since the Thresholds array is basically just free format strings, theoretically I could have just encoded these values into that, using special string labels.  That really bypasses the added value a schema provides though.\n\nIn regards to using the actual Sensor.Threshold.Warning/Critical interfaces, I couldn\u0027t see how to make that work: \n1) I have 4 levels here, not just two.\n2) The \u0027WarningLow\u0027 parameter I suppose I could use as the TempReset value, but that isn\u0027t what it\u0027s defined to be used as.  Not sure if other code uses it that way.",
