I want something simliar to blacklist. In my case, I might want to have an opposite approach (an allow list or an allow map).

Then, entity-manager determines which config to use base on the results.\n\nIn my case, I want to restrict the probing addresses in fru-device (at that moment, entity-manager doesn\u0027t know which board configs to use). In this case, I don\u0027t understand how does port object decribed in board configs fit into my case. One way is to parse all the board configs before starting probing the addresses per bus in fru-device. So that we know which addresses can be probed from the board configs. However, I am not so sure if it\u0027s the right direction.\n \nI guess I might misunstand something. Could you help to elaborate on that?",
