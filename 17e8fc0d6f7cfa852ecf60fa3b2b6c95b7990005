InterfacesAdded and InterfacesRemoved matches get added automatically, there\u0027s no need to configure it, and should be based on what interfaces exist in the entity files.\n\nPlease answer in your commit message.\n\nFWIW, I don\u0027t think this patchset as written is necessary, but I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re trying to accomplish.",

      "message": "At boot up of BMC, entity-manager is flood by the InterfacesAdded/InterfacesRemoved/nameOwnerChanged D-Bus signal. Because entity-manager monitor all of D-Bus interface and it is designed to only start the probing entity configuration when there are no new signal in 5 seconds. This leads the sensors are created late.\nThis is one of disadvantage of entity-manager and dbus-sensor model when compares with hwmon.\nMoreover, there are some sensors such as fans are used by thermal controls. At the boot up of BMC the thermal control services will start early to cool down the system. The delay in creating the fan sensors will need the unexpected action of thermal control services.\nThis patch set will limit the D-Bus signals are monitor by entity-manager to prevent the flood so the sensor configurations can be probed early. In that way, D-Bus sensors can create the sensors early.",
