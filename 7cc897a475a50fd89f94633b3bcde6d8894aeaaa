      "message": "@spinler@us.ibm.com\n\nThanks for the comment.\n\nIn this example, each device on the PCIe card is intentionally connected to a separate channel of the PCA9548 MUX. This reflects the hardware topology shown in the diagram and configuration, not a slot-level MUX design.\n\nThere is only a single MUX in this example; no additional MUX is assumed on the card. I’ve updated the document to clarify this, as other platforms may instead use one MUX channel per PCIe slot.",
