      "message": "+1.  leaving this inline with a .contains() seems easier, unless this is getting more cleanups in the future.  With that said, if Andrew is particularly attached to this method, I\u0027m not prepared to fight and die on that bridge, both are pretty subjective.\n\nFWIW, this check is a little broken;  We realistically should be using some kind of hash of the object (or maybe the probe inputs) to determine whether it\u0027s the same object, so maybe this method gets more complex in the future?",
