      "message": "Yeah agreed, I\u0027m totally fine with the Nvidia reference implementation. I was just posting the Rust and C++ coroutine variants to gauge interest and/or try to figure out how to onboard more quickly (this is the first time I\u0027m actually working on these dbus daemons).\n\nSo you guys are totally fine to just push the Nvidia reference in. But it needs entity-manager changes too right? Those weren\u0027t included afaict. I\u0027m also fine with just merging the downstream Nvidia reference configuration schema too.\n\nI really don\u0027t care that much about the way any of this code is written, I just want to see if merged. I\u0027m still trying to figure out how much flexibility *maintainers* will allow for in these things.",
