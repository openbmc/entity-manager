      "message": "I do not like `Type` field to be templated or otherwise variable.\n`Type` field is what is used by people to find the schema and create the dbus interfaces name.\n\nSo for both purposes `Type` should be fixed. Maybe topology schema needs to be reworked. Not sure how to go about this but could we extend `DownstreamPort` with an optional `ConnectsToName` property.\n\nFrom my understanding the ports are only consumed by EM to create the associations, so we should be free to make changes there?",
