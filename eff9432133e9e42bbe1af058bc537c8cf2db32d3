      "message": "I did more researching on using the probe D-Bus interface in entity-manager configuration as addition filter in added/removed_interface signal. From the probe D-Bus interface we can find the D-Bus services which create that D-Bus interface. Then we can use those service as sender filter for added/removed_interface signal. But there is one issue that matching signal is created when we start entity-manager, but at that time the source service of the D-Bus interface of the Probe configuration is not available. So we can\u0027t find the service name.\nUsing the service name configuration still is required.",
