      "message": "Right, maybe I could have done the rename of what was the \u0027properties\u0027 variable on line 46/47 in an earlier patch. But you\u0027ve also suggested squashing the rename patches into the code motion patches. If I\u0027m going to do that I think we keep this one as is? If we s/properties/interface/ below then we need to s/interface/interfaceName/ here.\n\npush_back() vs emplace_back() is a problem with constructors on the POD type and we can\u0027t avoid that unless we do something else entirely.",
