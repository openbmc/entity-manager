      "message": "what is the usecase for users changing thresholds via dbus and such?\n\nthresholds are provided in the configuration for PSU, Board, Chassis\nthere is no need to edit the configuration for thresholds as it is already present.\n\nusers can also edit the configuration files in /usr/share/entity-manager/configurations/  and restart the service. the changes will be applied and persisted.\n\nthere is no need to have separate mechanism to change the configuration. one mechanism is enough.\n\nthe current behavior is confusing and inconsistent. users expect a systemd service to reload all its configuration when it is restarted.",

I think there are probably redfish interfaces for fan tuning.\n\nAs for the thresholds I think there are external interfaces to modify them via Redfish and IPMI and they are then saved here.\n\nWhen EM was first written, or maybe when it was ported over from Intel\u0027s world, it didn\u0027t even put anything on D-Bus and just saved everything in system.json which is why it even exists in the first place.\n\nI would be all for moving away from it, we just don\u0027t want to break the people that need the persistence.",
