That\u0027s fine we didn\u0027t do that, but at least some amount of discussion around why/how we\u0027re doing this is probably warranted.\n\n\n\nas an aside on pushing this, I\u0027d much rather we just squash all the move commits in a single commit, so we know they\u0027re all done, and we can discuss what the folder structure afterward looks like in a single review, rather than having to check out the series, and leave N comments on each one.",
