      "message": "Why do you need this? Are you found some 3-d party device with broken FRU? We have lot of devices, which actually doesn\u0027t follow specification and so most check made as warnings, instead of errors. Here, as I see, you want to silently suppress parsing error.\n\nNote: the check was based on this statement in FRU specification:\n\u003e 5. More on Predefined and Custom Fields \n\u003e If an area is present (as indicated by a non-zero offset in the Common Header) the predefined fields for that area must also be present. The predefined fields can be made ‘Null’, however. This is done by setting the type/length byte to “xx000000” to indicate that the field has no data. All pre-defined fields must be present regardless of whether they are ‘Null’ or not. Custom fields must always be preceded with a type/length byte. The ‘end-of-fields’ byte and area checksum are also required.",
