Change from 5 seconds to 500ms is significant. I would like to understand how this number was picked. For example:\n\n1. What is the highest rate of propertyChanged signals?\n2. What is the longest and typical time for the handler callback. \n3. Why is 500ms a good number balancing between latency and performance",

(IBM doesn\u0027t use fru-device and uses openpower-vpd-parser instead, and there definitely isn\u0027t any 5 second delays between interfacesAdded there).  Even if there was, it should be fine if EM puts ifaces on D-Bus in more than one batch.  I\u0027d consider it a  bug if that didn\u0027t work.",

For example, with 100KHz i2c bus, 1 second means we can read 256 bytes FRU data for 48 devices and we probably don\u0027t expect many systems have 10x that number of FRUs. I don\u0027t have a particular strong objection with 500ms number, just want to ensure the reasoning is documented and sufficient tests have been done.",
