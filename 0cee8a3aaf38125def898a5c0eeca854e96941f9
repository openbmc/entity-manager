Change from 5 seconds to 500ms is significant. I would like to understand how this number was picked. For example:\n\n1. What is the highest rate of propertyChanged signals?\n2. What is the longest and typical time for the handler callback. \n3. Why is 500ms a good number balancing between latency and performance",
