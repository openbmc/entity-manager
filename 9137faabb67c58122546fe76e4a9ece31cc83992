This looks like you\u0027re relying on Name still, which is supposed to be an opaque field.  I know I mentioned that on the other review, but I\u0027ll mention it here as well just to provide context.\n\n\nI suspect for the moment dropping the Hard/Soft shutdown from this patchset, and moving it into a later patchset would help this merge faster, then we can discuss later in the greater context of entity-manager, because I suspect all the sensor daemons will need to agree on how we\u0027re going to handle these new config items.\n\nI\u0027ve seen proposed:\nChanging severity into an enum.\ndeclaring severities 3-5 for these new features.",
