      "message": "High level description:\n\n- **FIO (Front I/O controller)**  \n  Provides system status indicators (LEDs) and board information (FRU), and communicates with the Remote Management Controller (RMC) to ensure front-panel events are monitored and reported in real time.\n\n- **HDD \u0026 HDD_NVMe**  \n  Connected via the MCIO connector and CX8 interface, and linked to SSDs so that CX8 can carry high-speed traffic to and from the drives.\n\n- **HSC (Hot-Swap Controller)**  \n  Acts as the intermediary board between the motherboard and the bus bar, coordinating signal routing and data-path reconfiguration during hot-swap events to maintain data integrity and safe removal/insertion.\n\n- **OSFP (Octal Small Form-factor Pluggable)**  \n  Defines front-panel pluggable slots with eight high-speed electrical lanes. The Entity Manager reads the OSFP JSON definitions to detect inserted modules and exposes them via D-Bus for dynamic binding by other services.\n\n- **PDB (Power Distribution Board)**  \n  Manages and reports voltage and current on power rails for storage and networking modules. It exposes these metrics in JSON so that other components can throttle I/O or trigger alarms when approaching power limits.\n\n- **SCM (Secure Control Module)**  \n  Serves as the carrier board for the BMC, connecting to the Hardware Platform Manager (HPM) to monitor and manage secure-boot policies, cryptographic keys, and global configuration.",
