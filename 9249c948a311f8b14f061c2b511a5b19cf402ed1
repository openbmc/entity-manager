      "message": "Thank you for your review.\n\nWhat do you consider \"descriptive enough\"? I looked at some VR definitions in config and derived some common fields from that as a first step to create the schema. By \"VRs in the tree\" I can only guess you mean the configuration-files, but we lack a common template(schema) for VRs. In the future we want to update VRs over I2C with the new update flow from https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/code-update.md\nThere I want to implement device (VR) specific classes with the update specifics for each device, but with a common interface for providing the binary file and executing the update on the chip, taking care of pre and post conditions etc.\n\nThe schema can serve as a template or guideline for adding VRs to config files. Details in the schema can describe, if it\u0027s updateable with the flow mentioned above or not. \n\nRegarding 1.\n\nThe definition of thresholds from `legacy.json` is already of type array as shown below. My schema also contains the property \"Labels\", which can map a specific threshold to a label. (This is done in config files already)\n\n```\n\"Thresholds\": {\n                \"items\": {\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"Direction\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                        },\n                        \"Hysteresis\": {\n                            \"type\": \"number\"\n                        },\n                        \"Label\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                        },\n                        \"Name\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                        },\n                        \"Severity\": {\n                            \"type\": \"number\",\n                            \"minimum\": 0,\n                            \"maximum\": 4\n                        },\n                        \"Value\": {\n                            \"type\": \"number\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\"Direction\", \"Name\", \"Severity\", \"Value\"],\n                    \"type\": \"object\"\n                },\n                \"type\": \"array\"\n            },\n\n```",
