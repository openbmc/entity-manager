That confusion isn\u0027t helped by the fact that there\u0027s no commit message.",

The type itself \"VoltageRegulator\" implies that there\u0027s some standard for accessing VRs, which to my understanding there isn\u0027t.  If there is, please name it the name of the spec (as we\u0027ve done with other types like pmbus).",
