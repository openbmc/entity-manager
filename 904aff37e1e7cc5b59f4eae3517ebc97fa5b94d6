      "message": "The goal of this patch is just to remove the global variable.\n\nNot passing `io` around anymore would increase the diff of this patch and then\nwe would have a patch changing 2 things at the same time.\n\n\u003e The class was created with a small amount of changes.\nIt does not aim to be a good abstraction for entity-manager\u0027s dbus\ninterface, the primary goal is to get rid of the global variable and\navoid passing it through a bunch of functions.\n\nWe can always add `io` and `objServer` references to the class at a later point\nbut i would avoid creating an extra patch for it just now since there are already many patches in the series waiting for review.",
