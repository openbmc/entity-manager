      "message": "To test new EM configs, one just throws the file into /etc/entity-manager/ or into the configuration dir down in /usr/share. \n\nNow if one were to try to do that but forgot to rename the file, there\u0027d be 2 files with the same probe and EM would throw away whichever ifaces were probed last.\n\nSo I don\u0027t know what I think of this.  At the very least, we\u0027d want some guidelines in the readme about the vendor subdirs and testing implications.\n\nAlternatively I guess we could just have EM recursively look for files and not flatten out the structure?",

As I was doing the `meson install` I realized the current behavior had the potential for collisions and just tried something to avoid it.\n\nI\u0027d rather not prepend the name to every file like that.  I think I\u0027ll look at implementing it on the server side, like Matt said, to have it go recursive.",
