      "message": "To test new EM configs, one just throws the file into /etc/entity-manager/ or into the configuration dir down in /usr/share. \n\nNow if one were to try to do that but forgot to rename the file, there\u0027d be 2 files with the same probe and EM would throw away whichever ifaces were probed last.\n\nSo I don\u0027t know what I think of this.  At the very least, we\u0027d want some guidelines in the readme about the vendor subdirs and testing implications.\n\nAlternatively I guess we could just have EM recursively look for files and not flatten out the structure?",
