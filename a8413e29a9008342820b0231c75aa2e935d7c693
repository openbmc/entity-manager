I\u0027m a little worried about having to modify this call every time we roll clang.\n\nI wonder if this whole script should\u0027ve been a run-ci script instead of a format-code script?  Or is there a way to check for and call the openbmc-build-scripts format-code?",

      "message": "Okay, so I was going off my memory of some of the behaviour of openbmc-build-scripts here, given that I added the support for the in-repo format-code script initially.\n\nSo my memory was the formatting in openbmc-build-scripts was mutually exclusive with the presence of format-code in the target repo (i.e. if format-code existed in the target repo, it was run instead of the default formatting provided by openbmc-build-scripts). That mutual exclusion is implemented here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/blob/0ea75ec9efb7ffacb88f63e38fa7823fe8b124a7/scripts/unit-test.py#L1215-L1226\n\nThis would explain why there were some formatting issues in the codebase.\n\nThe additional call to format-code at [1] doesn\u0027t seem sensible any more, I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s there.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/blob/ac5915f07d3b796f224c85477763ca7fe893dcc2/scripts/format-code.sh#L136-L141",

      "message": "well, originally it was the use case from phosphor-mboxd where we had a mixed C and C++ codebase where the C followed kernel-style and the C++ followed the OpenBMC style. clang-format doesn\u0027t differentiate between formatting controls for C and C++, so we needed separate config files, and it was just easier to hijack the whole process rather than try to rely on openbmc-build-scripts providing some default behaviour (as clang-format\u0027s -style\u003dfile at the time didn\u0027t support any name for the formatting configuration file beyond .clang-format, which I still find incredible, and so we needed to symlink two different configurations into place and invoke clang-format twice).\n\nThat said we should probably have a discussion either in discord and/or the mailing list about how to resolve this more broadly.",
