      "message": "I do not think we should add a dbus interface for this.\n\n1. entity-manager could use inotify to identify changes in the directories it is watching.  There is really no need for anyone to explicitly tell it to reload the JSON.\n\n2. If we didn\u0027t want to use inotify, we can support `systemctl reload` which is the standard way of telling a daemon to reload its configuration.\n\nI don\u0027t really want new undocumented human-only dbus interfaces, especially when there are more standard ways to express the same behavior.",

      "message": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\nMy original motivation was the following: when entity-manager works together with phosphor-pid-control.service, updating the entire fan table at runtime currently requires:\n\n1. Modifying the fan-related JSON files inside entity-manager\n\n2. Deleting /var/configuration/system.json\n\n3. Restarting the entity-manager service\n\n4. Restarting entity-manager may affect other services that depend on it, causing unnecessary coupling across packages.\n\nThat’s why I initially considered adding a method to reload the JSON configuration without restarting the service. The intention was to make fan table updates more isolated and reduce the impact on other components.",
