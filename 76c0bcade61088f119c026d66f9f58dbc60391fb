In the simplest example, the serial number of the chassis is not the same as the serial number of the motherboard, so they need separate paths to represent the components (even if you might not have the chassis serial number available).",

If you can hold something in your hand separately, then it gets its own file.  Just because it\u0027s not FRU detectable doesn\u0027t change that.
