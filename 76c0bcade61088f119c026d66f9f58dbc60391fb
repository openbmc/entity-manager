      "message": "Seems like you could make the same argument here about \"why do you have a chassis and a board\".  Again the chassis + board serial are the same and contained on the same EEPROM (the board is simply screwed into the sheet metal to make a chassis).\n\nThe Yv2 baseboard contains the EEPROM, which contains the serial number.  By nature of it being a baseboard we can assume it is also screwed into a chassis.  Are you suggesting we need a separate path?",

There isn\u0027t any identifying information (FRU) for the Chassis, really and I\u0027m not sure if you would call the bits of plastic much of a Chassis anyhow.\n\n\nTwinlakes is a compute card which plugs into a Yv2.
