      "message": "Our platform\u0027s PowerSupply cards are not always with a FRU, so we chose to fixedly place psu sensor configs in MB\u0027s config, and this part of config is just to expose PowerSupply inventory onto Redfish if a FRU is present at that specific bus-address of the platform. I know this is not right, but this works for our platforms, so I hide this into the same file with MB.",

      "message": "PSUs are pluggable devices so different PSU devices might be used in different system shipments, just to ensure they provide enough power for the system. Actually, I saw at least 4 different PSU devices used for this system so if using FRUs to probe the devices, we will have several configurations to do.\nIn addition, as different platforms might have different I2C buses for the PSUs, they can\u0027t be shared across platforms. So, we chose to use I2C bus and address to probe PSU devices",
