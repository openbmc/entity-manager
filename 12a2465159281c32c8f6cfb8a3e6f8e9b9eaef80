      "message": "Our platform\u0027s PowerSupply cards are not always with a FRU, so we chose to fixedly place psu sensor configs in MB\u0027s config, and this part of config is just to expose PowerSupply inventory onto Redfish if a FRU is present at that specific bus-address of the platform. I know this is not right, but this works for our platforms, so I hide this into the same file with MB.",
