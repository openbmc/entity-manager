      "message": "Having an EM reference here could work but then we have the situation\nof circular references.\n\nSince EM has EMDBusInterface as a member.\n\nFor the intention of the patch, currently it is very simple as noted in the commit message.\n\nTo have a class to store ```inventory``` map and enable some functions to access it as before.\n\nThat change by itself is simple. If we get into OOP design with this change, it can be a long-winded discussion üòä. So this patch is more of a keep it simple/stupid kind of patch.\n\nMaybe in your series you will get to a different abstraction which is better üëç",
