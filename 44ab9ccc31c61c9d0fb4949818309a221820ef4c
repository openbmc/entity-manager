I will assume you had the best of intentions and just missed it, but please recognize that it increases maintainer load when you do that.",

      "message": "Alexander, please do better.  Honestly, if you\u0027d asked me if I thought this should be retained, I probably would\u0027ve agreed with you that this feature wasn\u0027t useful, and could probably be put behind the same option we used elsewhere.  But I don\u0027t want to have to go hunt through the patchset to go figure it out that it broke something, I\u0027d like to be able to take your commit messages as stated, or have them phrased as \"this breaks XYZ, do we care?\".  Not doing that means maintainers can\u0027t review yours and others patchsets as quickly, which is worse for the project overall.",
