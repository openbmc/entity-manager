      "message": "Yeah; once this restructuring is propagated through all the other dbus-sensors daemons it\u0027ll be a matter of determining which daemon is the relevant one for a given sensor and looking there.\n\nThough at the same time, I think arguably with the old way entity-manager \"supporting\" a given device type didn\u0027t really mean much beyond passing its config through to dbus-sensors, and the dbus-sensors daemons had to also have a similar hard-coded list of supported devices, so at least this way adding a new device type can be done in one place instead of requiring modifications to both.",
