      "message": "Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but validateHeader() used to probe FRU, so it\u0027s likely also called for non-fru eeproms. The purpose is to check if first data block looks like FRU header - so errors here is normal behaviour and that\u0027s why it is silent.\nIf you want to have logs here, it is better to hide them under if(DEBUG) statement.",
