      "message": "Hi @alexander.hansen@9elements.com, thanks for pointing out. I moved \"MuxChannel\" into the subschemas of each sensor (the impact list is added to the commit msg). However, I still temporarily put one \"MuxChannel\" property in \"Aggregate\" until your extract patches are fully merged.\n\nFYI, I added a [patch](https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/79539/1) to this relation chain to remove Bus/Address from ADC because they are redundant. My apology that we Ampere accidentally put them in our config which must have been part of the reason you added them to ADC subschema.",
