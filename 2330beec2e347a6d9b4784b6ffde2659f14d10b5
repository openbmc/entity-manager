      "message": "Yes, it will show on DBus as indexed xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.EEPROMDeviceFirmware.MuxGPIOsX. Since there are cases where multiple GPIOs need to be set up to mux the EEPROM device to the BMC, this approach ensures flexibility in handling different hardware configurations.\n\nI understand that this makes the reactor-side handling more involved and prevents the use of phosphor-dbus-interfaces generated bindings. Do you have any suggestions or alternative ways to structure this on DBus while still supporting multiple GPIOs for muxing?",
