And i did not want to get blocked on waiting for someone from meta to look into it.\n\nSo i was hoping they will fix this on their own when they notice their config failing to validate.\n\n\u003e Can you add to the commit message why this is failing\n\nDone üëç\n\nLet me know if you have other thoughts. I can add some folks to this review who own / contribute to the meta configs, so they will be aware that their config is broken and then they can fix it in another patch.",
