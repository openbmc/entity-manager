      "message": "Should we really be covering up the error in that case?  A little more detail here on the tradeoffs of making this change would be good.  This means that if we write the same value to a field, the actual fru content of the field would change.  That might have user impacts, and given that the FRU spec has a size in it, FRU eeproms that have trailing spaces are arguably incorrect.\n\nIf we decide this is needed, are there any other characters that need trimmed?  null?  unprintable characters?",
