I\u0027d rather we get it down to a single policy, where we make the intent clear, then call out degenerate cases like OCP explicitly with a policy, rather than try to make it generic.  I suspect this is one of those things where most of us \"know\" what the right answer is, but writing down rules that we can point to when people commit things is hard.",
