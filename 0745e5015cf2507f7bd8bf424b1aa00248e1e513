      "message": "As a maintainer, the effort I put into reviewing patch is usually proportional to the effort I perceive has been spent on creating the change, along with the existing trust I have in the contributor. Currently I have no existing trust relationship with you as a contributor, and the lack of effort with this commit message and the communication style so far don\u0027t inspire me to put much more effort in to the patch as it stands. Ultimately you want to leave no room for maintainers to say \"no\" to your work and to provide compelling reasons for it to be merged. \n\nThere appears to be a bug, but I\u0027m happy for it to stay that way until there\u0027s more effort put into the change and the communication.\n\nThis is the upstream project - it is canonical. Please provide the entire justification for the change in the commit message, in a way that the argument stands on its own and without any references to the inaccessible fork.",
