      "message": "I brought up in discord about how EM is almost creating the inventory.item interface today, and proposed finishing that off.  If nobody complains, we can do that and then we\u0027d just automatically get it for everything, with the PrettyName just being set to the Name of the entity.",

      "message": "Thanks for that. Although in my personal opinion it\u0027s more reasonable and makes work light to let whoever needs the interface configure it, having Name and PrettyName of different strings under one object path looks redundant. I\u0027ll see for a few more days if there\u0027s any reply and then push a patch for it.",
