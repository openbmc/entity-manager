This kind of implies that this doesn\u0027t really need to be configurable at the level you\u0027re doing, and as it exists today, could be 100% covered by intelligent defaults.  I\u0027m open to some of this stuff needing to be non-default, and per-entity configurable, but lets evaluate this a bit, while at the same time adding more details to the commit message.  You\u0027ve added 6 new properties, and a new Type, with no definition, and no links to backends in review for consumption of this information.",

The Chassis is a piece of sheet metal, with no processor, VR or power system for which these parameters would effect, so it\u0027s a little odd that it would contain any mention of Utilization things.  It feels a little like this file is trying to tease at a collection of components being the \"platform\" but those patches haven\u0027t really been done yet, and the design docs never got fully realized, so I wonder if we\u0027re teasing out into the \"we need a new class of EM config file\" question again.\n\nMore details on what you\u0027re trying to accomplish here would be great.",
