Not sure why it\u0027s stacked with other unrelated patches.\n\nBecause i do not want to create these headers anymore from this point onwards in the chain.\n\nI do not see any issue with this so i can just wait until the review arrives at this point or rebase it further down in case there are any issues with patches below.\n\nOtherwise i would have to keep creating those copyright headers and just create merge conflict with myself.",

Understand this is just a cleanup and you\u0027re willing to wait, it\u0027s just easier to merge quickly if chains encapsulate a piece of functionality.",
