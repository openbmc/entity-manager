      "message": "Hi Ed,\nIn my case, the BMC uses intel-ipmi-oem, entity-manager, and dbus-sensors to manage the motherboard\u0027s sensors. I intend to retrieve entityID and entityInstance via IPMI command, e.g., ipmitool sensor get \u003csensor name\u003e.\n\nHowever, intel-ipmi-oem always tries to find the sensor\u0027s \"entityID\" and \"entityInstance\" from its entity-manager entry. \n(please refer to:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/intel-ipmi-oem/blob/09701efa93f2e9b25b19c4560db60c1878ef8a9c/include/sdrutils.hpp#L438 and\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/intel-ipmi-oem/blob/09701efa93f2e9b25b19c4560db60c1878ef8a9c/include/sdrutils.hpp#L470)\n\nIt seems like the source code of intel-ipmi-oem needs these two properties, but schema doesn\u0027t include them. I get confused about it. Is there any suggestion?",
