If you need more than it provides, please add more details in your commit about your use case, and we\u0027ll see if we can get it updated, but it\u0027s the parameter designed to implement this.\n\n\nEntityId needs to be determined from an equivalent dbus type, specified in phosphor-dbus-interfaces.",
