There is more to the product name than just \".*\".  It is matching on \"Yosemite V3.5 \" first.  The rest of it is the revision.\n\nIn bletchley we do have a differentiation between some revisions because there are some board differences between EVT and DVT that needed to be compensated for, but otherwise, this seems to match the pattern of the `fby2.json` and `fbtp.json`.",

Even\n\nYosemite V3.5 [a-zA-Z+][0-9]+ would be better here, as at least we limit the character sets.\nWith that said, if you\u0027re fine with this as-is, I\u0027m not going to stand on this bridge.
