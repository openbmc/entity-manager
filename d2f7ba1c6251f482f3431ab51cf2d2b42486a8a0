I\u0027m not sure the JsonSchema stuff is complete enough (it enforces schema but not really correctness), and it gives a false sense of safety such that lots of people (in my experience) will make changes without testing, because \"there is testing of the json configs.\"",

It would be worth using what the devicetree people have done as a reference wrt JSON schema. They\u0027re solving (almost literally) the same problem.\n\n\u003e I\u0027m not sure the JsonSchema stuff is complete enough (it enforces schema but not really correctness)\n\nCan you unpack what your expectations are on \"correctness\"? Without understanding that I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to agree on the value of JSON schema. I think it\u0027s worthwhile.",
