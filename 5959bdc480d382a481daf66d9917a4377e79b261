Just pass each parameter by name individually.  Having them alltogether in the tuple saves us a couple commas, and causes us the heartache of a gazillion std::get\u003c\u003e calls that make me want to scream.\n\nI\u0027d probably prefer #2, just because it cleans up the code and makes it more readable without inventing another struct, but I\u0027m up for either.",
