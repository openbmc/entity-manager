A revision with the suggestions accepted is here:\n\n75353: entity-manager: dt-vpd daemon broken by ci tool changes | https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/75353\n\nI plan to ask around on the OBMC discord in the near future for help figuring out what needs to be done (but am about to be headed out to a doc apt today)",

The only thing that\u0027s necessary is testing if the file exists.",
