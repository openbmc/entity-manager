If you think it would\u0027ve changed the result, I\u0027m happy to discuss now, or if you\u0027d like to reapply this to master to discuss, or reopen a new commit with these changes for a place to discuss, I\u0027m happy to do that.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know that it would have changed the result but probably the timeline.  What happened here was:\n\n- There was a discussion on Discord about the way to add this to mctpd.\n- We implemented EM and mctpd changes and sent PRs.\n- EM was accepted and then mctpd side decided they didn\u0027t want to continue down that direction.\n- Andrew started writing an alternative, which isn\u0027t yet complete.\n\nWe were holding the mctpd patches downstream (https://github.com/facebook/openbmc/blob/helium/meta-facebook/meta-yosemite4/recipes-networking/mctp/files/0503-Add-method-for-setting-up-MCTP-EID-by-config-path.patch) until Andrew\u0027s code is complete and we can transition to this.\n\nWe were caught off guard here by the EM change suddenly being removed and breaking us downstream.  We will add a revert-revert patch in downstream now.",
