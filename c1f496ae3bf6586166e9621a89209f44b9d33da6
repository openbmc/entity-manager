      "message": "This is an entity-manager only file.  Looks like though it gets used by utils.cpp, in a function that is also an EM only function.\n\nfru-device and entity-manager appear to share just a few things in utils, most of utils is for entity-manager.\n\nSo at the very least maybe could you move those templateCharReplace functions into expressions.* (or somewhere else) so that the expressions files can be EM only?\n\nIdeally I think EM would get its own util.* files, with then a very small shared one would be left between the two.  Looks like fru-device already has its own fru_utils files.",
