      "message": "Do not sign up others for maintainership roles;  Unless my search failed, I haven\u0027t seen any contributions from Marvin, so this kind of maintainership is inappropriate.  I also don\u0027t see him in the latest roll call.\n\nAlexander, given that in the past you\u0027ve outright ignored written rules in ways that take significant amount of maintainer time, I\u0027m not personally comfortable sharing maintainership of this folder with you without review.  This commit is a good example that you need some level of review before checkin (given that you\u0027ve not modeled the nic correctly).\n\nI would be ecstatic for you AND marvin to add yourself as reviewers and do more review.\n\nIf other maintainers feel differently, I\u0027m happy to have that discussion.",
