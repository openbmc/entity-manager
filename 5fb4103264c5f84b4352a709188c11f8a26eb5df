The intent of the policy was one file per piece of hardware.\n\nThere might be cases where a piece of hardware \"acts\" differently dependent on location, or if it\u0027s in different modes.   Those different \"modes\" are intended to be captured in the array, so we keep one file per config.\n\nLets make sure the PR matches what the policy intent is.",

I do not think there is any code which would treat them differently based on which file they come from.\nIf you have a concern around losing track of related configuration, i think creating a folder for related configuration files can solve that issue.\n\n\u003e What is the advantage of splitting this config into multiple files\n\nI want to simplify this aspect of EM which will\n- simplify the schema\n- simplify runtime code\n- simplify scripts for validation of configuration\n- indentation is reduced \n- no \u00272 ways of doing something\u0027\n\n\u003e Has there been any formal discussion on this change?\n\nNot much discussion. I think the patch is the right place to discuss this.",
