      "message": "Thanks for taking an interest in this change ðŸ˜Š\n\n\u003e TBH One can also prefer to keep the related configuration in a single file to avoid creating multiple files.\n\nTo EM, these configurations are unrelated. I do not think there is any code which would treat them differently based on which file they come from.\nIf you have a concern around losing track of related configuration, i think creating a folder for related configuration files can solve that issue.\n\n\u003e What is the advantage of splitting this config into multiple files\n\nI want to simplify this aspect of EM which will\n- simplify the schema\n- simplify runtime code\n- simplify scripts for validation of configuration\n- indentation is reduced \n- no \u00272 ways of doing something\u0027\n\n\u003e Has there been any formal discussion on this change?\n\nNot much discussion. I think the patch is the right place to discuss this.",
