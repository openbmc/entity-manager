The intent of the policy was one file per piece of hardware.\n\nI should have probably read the ```README.md``` where this policy is mentioned üëç\n\nI am wondering if the policy intent is worth keeping.\n\nIn case of a complicated piece of hardware with variants and modes requiring different configuration files, i would rather have a folder to keep them in.\n\nThis can give the advantage to easily ```diff``` the variants of that piece of hardware.\n\nWith a combined file, it would still be possible to ```diff``` them but may require special scripts. I am wondering how you handle this use-case.\n\nI see the concern that people may lose track of multiple configurations supporting a piece of hardware if they are not properly kept in folders. But i would assume good intent from people to keep their configurations organized.\n\nThere is another patch in this change to introduce ```CompatibleHardware``` property at EM Config toplevel to support another feature. Maybe that can help to keep track of multiple configurations supporting a piece of hardware.",

I do not think there is any code which would treat them differently based on which file they come from.\nIf you have a concern around losing track of related configuration, i think creating a folder for related configuration files can solve that issue.\n\n\u003e What is the advantage of splitting this config into multiple files\n\nI want to simplify this aspect of EM which will\n- simplify the schema\n- simplify runtime code\n- simplify scripts for validation of configuration\n- indentation is reduced \n- no \u00272 ways of doing something\u0027\n\n\u003e Has there been any formal discussion on this change?\n\nNot much discussion.
