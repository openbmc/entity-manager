Is this only for like sensors?\n\nWhat if we want to have dynamic connection like a FRU that has multiple slots that connects to more FURs. Will that work?\n\nWith that it is not guarantee that all the FRUs are connected. Those FRUs will be a board itself. Do we just want a mapping to the address/bus that we know... and then look at the actual FRU instead?",
