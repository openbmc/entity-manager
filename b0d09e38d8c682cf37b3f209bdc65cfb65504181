Here in upstream, we get to look at OpenBMC as a whole of more than one platform.  Platform specifics (if we want to support that) would go in meta layers.\n\n\u003e I would prefer people to have their configurations upstream instead.\n\nI\u0027m confused, what\u0027s stopping them from upstreaming those?  The first looks like we missed a probe for manufacturer, which I\u0027d really like to start requiring on all new configs, but we haven\u0027t gotten there yet.  For that device, I think it\u0027s already been fixed?\n\nFwiw, the second one also has a bad probe:\n```\n        \"xyz.openbmc_project.FruDevice({\u0027BOARD_PART_NUMBER\u0027: \u0027CBP2980\u0027})\"\n```\n\nIs the fix to this just that we need to require all FRU probes to have some level of manufacturer matching?  That seems a lot easier to maintain and support (we can get a CI check for it) than trying to segment who wants which configs.\n\n\u003e Did this actually happen in EM?\n\nYep, still exists on master too:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-amd/meta-daytonax/recipes-phosphor/configuration/entity-manager/daytonax-baseboard.json",
