      "message": "Please wrap this line.  Also, I think it should be worded a little more strongly, something like \"should not be scanned\" instead of \"don\u0027t need to be scan[ned]\".\n\nWhile it can sort of be inferred from the content, I think it would be good to mention explicitly somewhere in this document that a bare-integer entry blocks an entire bus from being scanned, while a bus/addresses object can be used for more fine-grained control to block specific addresses but allow scanning other addresses on the same bus.",
