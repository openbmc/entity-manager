      "message": "In bmcweb we already attempt to parse this value as a uint64_t https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/redfish-core/include/redfish_aggregator.hpp#L350.  It should be fine if we want to use a uint64 instead of string for the \"type\".  I also verified with local testing that aggregation still works if the \"type\" for \"Port\" is a uint64.\n\nIf we want to be really specific, ports can only be represented by a uint16.  Entity-manager seems to expose positive numbers as uint64 so that\u0027s why in bmcweb we first parse the number as a uint64_t and then later make sure it can be represented as a uint16_t https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/redfish-core/include/redfish_aggregator.hpp#L357.  Based on that I don\u0027t know how specific we can be in defining the type of uint to use.",
