The handler was invoked and returned immediately, but the event hadn’t been consumed yet. sd_event polled the FD again in the same iteration and saw it was still readable, so it marked it with EPOLLIN again. \nOn the next iteration, sd_event dispatched this event, causing fdio-\u003enext() to resume another coroutine.
