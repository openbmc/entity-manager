For example we\u0027ll need to associate a slot with its fault LED right next to the connector and be able to light it based on the location code even if the slot is empty, like for a missing DIMM that should be present.\n\n(Our location codes are also hierarchical, and built up as segments based on the plugging, so eventually I\u0027ll need to add in code here to handle that as well.)",
