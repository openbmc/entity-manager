      "message": "Can you add in here what (redfish?) code is going to look at this?\n\nThings are going to get interesting, because we (IBM) are going to only need the location code interface on the upstream connector/slot. For example we\u0027ll need to associate a slot with its fault LED right next to the connector and be able to light it based on the location code even if the slot is empty, like for a missing DIMM that should be present.\n\n(Our location codes are also hierarchical, and built up as segments based on the plugging, so eventually I\u0027ll need to add in code here to handle that as well.)",

It won\u0027t look at the upstream connector for it. That is don\u0027t because there can be multiple devices connect to the same slot, so this way we can uniquely identify the downstream ports instead of all of them having the upstream ports\u0027 location.",

      "message": "\"there can be multiple devices connect to the same slot\"\n You just mean there are multiple types of devices, of which only one will be present at a time, right?  Because I\u0027d say by definition a slot should only have one entity in it at a time, otherwise you could just have 2 slots.\n \nLooking at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/51879, it looks like the code is looking for the LocationCode interface on the same object path as the Inventory.Item.Cpu object, which isn\u0027t the connector.\n\nso what if you put the interface on the entity itself?",
