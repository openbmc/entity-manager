      "message": "This seems out of place here -- the increased PollRate is due to the system I\u0027ve got these in being unable to keep up with the default 1-second poll interval that psusensor uses, but that seems more like a property of the system itself rather than this specific PSU.\n\nThe most natural solution seems like some configuration for psusensor itself (as opposed to the devices it monitors) to set its default poll interval, but I\u0027m not sure what the appropriate mechanism for that would be -- would a simple command-line flag do?",

      "message": "This naming isn\u0027t ideal -- `$index` seems like the \"appropriate\" thing to use here, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any guarantee on the order those index numbers get assigned.  The PSUs themselves live in slots numbered 1 through 6 (which are the numbers I\u0027d prefer this to use), so I\u0027ve used `$bus` here instead to at least get the naming consistent, since each slot has a bus dedicated to it; ideally there\u0027d be some way to statically express that mapping such that the one on bus X would always be named \"PSU Y\", but I don\u0027t know of any existing way to achieve that.",
