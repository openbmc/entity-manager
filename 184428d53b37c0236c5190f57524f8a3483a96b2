If we\u0027re just mapping this to \"com.meta.Inventory.ManufacturerExt.Field.FBPN\", just make a meta OEM interface, put it in an OEM Redfish interface and be done with it, there\u0027s no need to try to put this into a dictionary interface (which, based on the definition, bmcweb wouldn\u0027t be able to parse anyway, because the keys aren\u0027t specified, so we wouldn\u0027t be able to parse it to a single property anyway).\n\nIf we want to turn this field into the SparePartNumber, there\u0027s already an existing dbus interface for that and examples of how to do that in a config file.  I suspect if you go that route, no additional code would be necessary.",
