      "message": "quick high level question - there will be multiple ps supported (2000W, 1000W, 1600W, 1400W). would those just have different \"Names\" on line 26?  I was assuming they would each have a different json file altogether - if so maybe the name of the json file should be more specific?\n\nIf one shared file, then the thresholds should be different, as some of them can be plugged into 110v as well.",

      "message": "Yeah, one shared file. What I understand from Brad is that these power supplies have the special IBM CFF connector, otherwise we could just list them individually as VENDOR_PSU.json file like the others PSUs, but I\u0027ll let Brad confirm.\n\nWe can also specify the vendor in the name. Something like \"Delta 1600W CFFPS\" instead of \"IBM\"?\n\nTalking with Brad too, created a new type PowerSupplyLabel as pmbus is used mainly by the sensor application.",
