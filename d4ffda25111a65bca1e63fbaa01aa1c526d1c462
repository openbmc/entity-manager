You\u0027re right that it\u0027s not yet useful for pluggable cards.\n\nThe extra code we need in EM is probably best hashed out in a design doc. Having thought about it a bit, I suspect it might be useful for EM to process events from a `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` socket. Other choices seem unwieldy (e.g. leaving that to udev, and then poking EM via a D-Bus interface from a helper binary launched from a udev rule like we do for phosphor-led-sysfs).\n\nUSB is self-describing so I think it\u0027s reasonable that we allow probes based on the info there and not tie it to a FRU EEPROM? This will get us inventory for the device in EM (which is necessary for the purpose of OpenBMC and eliminates a udev-only solution). From there we can fill in bus and port info from sysfs based on the uevent.\n\n\u003e So what I am thinking is reading the of_node property and mapping it against the device-tree alias, would that be an acceptable solution?\n\nIt would be better if the usb subsystem applied aliases itself like the i2c subsystem.
