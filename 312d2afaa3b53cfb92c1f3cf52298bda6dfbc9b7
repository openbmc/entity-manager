      "message": "Am I understanding correctly that the aim of this change is to make it so that when a new EM config is added to configurations/, the submitter would run generate_config_list.sh, then commit the updates configurations/meson.build along with their changes-- instead of just updating the existing meson.build like we\u0027d do today?\n\n\nWhen you say\n\n\u003e There is a tradeoff when running a command to get the filenames, as it\nmay not regenerate when file is added/removed\n\nThat sounds like a potentially serious tradeoff if we\u0027re replacing the existing list (relatively easy for change submitters to maintain, IMO) with a file that has \u0027# This file is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.\u0027 at the top.\n\nWhat situations would result in the script *not* updating the list when a config is added or removed?",
