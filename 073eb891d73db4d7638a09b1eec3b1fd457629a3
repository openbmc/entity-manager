      "message": "I\u0027ve been learning how to use a local copy of the CI to fix the code-format errors, and hopefully my latest upload will go through.\n\nThanks for the help the other day with getting the CI to check my changes after I (guess?) I stalled it out, BTW! üëç \n\nI assume the \u0027stall\u0027 happened because I rebased my code to master on my machine, then pushed the amend to Gerrit while this review was marked as \"work in progress.\" I changed the review status back to \u0027active\u0027 after uploading, but seems like the CI wasn\u0027t checking the code when I did things that way. \n\nAm I right to think that you fixed the issue just by running \u0027rebase\u0027 to Master from the Gerrit page here?",
