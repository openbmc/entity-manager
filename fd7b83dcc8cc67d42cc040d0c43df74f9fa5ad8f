      "message": "There is code that made a half-hearted attempt to create the inventory.item interface on every single entity here: https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/src/entity_manager.cpp#L605\n\nHowever, it doesn\u0027t add any properties to that interface, nor call initialize() to actually put it on D-Bus.  It would be pretty easy to just fix up that and then every entity gets that interface.  Frankly I\u0027m surprised that isn\u0027t actually needed by redfish code already, but I guess it isn\u0027t.\n\nSo I\u0027m not sure if it would be better to add it for everyone, or for just the people that need it like you did.",
