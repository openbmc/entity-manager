      "message": "There is code that made a half-hearted attempt to create the inventory.item interface on every single entity here: https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/src/entity_manager.cpp#L605\n\nHowever, it doesn\u0027t add any properties to that interface, nor call initialize() to actually put it on D-Bus.  It would be pretty easy to just fix up that and then every entity gets that interface.  Frankly I\u0027m surprised that isn\u0027t actually needed by redfish code already, but I guess it isn\u0027t.\n\nSo I\u0027m not sure if it would be better to add it for everyone, or for just the people that need it like you did.",

      "message": "Yeah, Redfish only cares about the `Presence` property under `xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item` for others but not chassis.\n\nBut PDI says it is required by all objects within the inventory namespace (https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/5e7bca41c4460abb6f513ae8e0a67c551d6192a5/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Item.interface.yaml#L2). How should this be rephrased?.\n\nIf it was to be added for every chassis, I wonder what is the difference between it and `xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Board/Chassis` that is strong enough to force this, and what should be used to put in `PrettyName` (configurable or the same as Name under xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Board/Chassis).\n\nI wish I knew the reason behind https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/src/entity_manager.cpp#L605.",
