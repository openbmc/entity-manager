If you don\u0027t have a way to test the other disconnected fan headers, that\u0027s fine, but lets make some assumptions that the other two fan headers are hooked to PWM 0 and 1 (given this starts at 3) and put that in the config.\n\nIf we\u0027re wrong, we can always fix it later once we have an acceptable fan setup, but I\u0027d rather we not accentually break this later by adding fan headers.",
