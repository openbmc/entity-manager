Only took 4 years for me to be vindicated ðŸ˜Š\n\nThis is on my list to review (haven\u0027t done yet).  Given the possibilities of race conditions, testing this is going to be fun, but we\u0027ll get that figured out.",

      "message": "Yeah, async behavior is not obvious in these these case. When I initially read this code, I thought getBusFRUs would return and let the async thread keep running in the background (which would be bad). But then I tested out a simple example and saw that ~future() waits for the task to exit (and confirmed this behavior is documented on cppreference).\n\nI\u0027m just learning about fru-device and noticed this weird code, so I welcome any suggestions for testing it.",
