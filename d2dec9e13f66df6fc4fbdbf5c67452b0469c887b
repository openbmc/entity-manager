I understand for a time that we\u0027ve very likely to need to duplicate the ExportTemplate struct as well as some of the code to do the instantiation, and I think that\u0027s ok.  I\u0027d rather that than put this data on dbus.  (it also seems much easier)",

I read this part:\n\" E-M publishes on dbus the information needed to instantiate the device\"\nAnd totally missed this:\n\"(a template-substituted version of ExportTemplate, basically)\"\n\n\nMy bad for leading you down the wrong path.  Ultimately, in the end state I would like entity-manager to know nothing about devicetree, and push that all into the individual daemons.  I think duplicating some of the code gets us to that result faster, otherwise we go\n\ninvent dbus interface\nget things working with interface\ncopy code over and remove interface from dbus-sensors\ndelete interface from entity-manager.\n\nThat seems like way more work to me, and the dt instantiation code isn\u0027t that big.",
