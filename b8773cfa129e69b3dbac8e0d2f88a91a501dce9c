      "message": "As I understand it, this is the bit that associates a chassis with a \u0027type:fan\u0027 entity (probe + exposes) called out in an EM json. \n\nThe FanSensor parts association records (after the dbus-sensors PR is accepted) uses the associations called out here to link sensors to the chasis so they\u0027ll show up in redfish/bmcweb on the sensors page.\n\nThe \u0027type:fan\u0027 entity seems to be needed to get a \u0027fan\u0027 item to show up in the webui inventory page, but I\u0027m still experimenting around there to get a handle on the finer details on the display there.",
