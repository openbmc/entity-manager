      "message": "CI of course isn\u0027t going to accept this as-is due to the formatting...\n\nWith the uniformity of the efuse entries, having each one be a single line like this makes it a *lot* easier to eyeball and verify that things are all consistent and any changes have been applied the same way across all of them; do the maintainers feel that\u0027s a strong enough reason to make an exception to the usual formatting rules?\n\n(If so, there\u0027s the separate follow-on question of if there\u0027s a easy way to manually override the automation in this particular care -- lacking comments I dunno if json has any real way to insert \"pragma\"-like directives.)",
