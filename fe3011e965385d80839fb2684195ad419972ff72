      "message": "It would be nice to have some manual tests / inspection done modifying various properties at different levels of the object tree to confirm the code path in `addProperty` is working and the json pointer is correctly set.\n\n- board/chassis interface\n- extra interfaces added in the EM config\n- exposes records\n- nested objects within exposes records\n- association interfaces\n\nIt would also be good to `busctl introspect` the various object paths to check that the writable interfaces (see `getPermission` function) are writable and other properties are not writable.",
