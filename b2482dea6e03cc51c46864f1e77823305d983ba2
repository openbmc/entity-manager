If I look at the `fbtp.json` as an example, there are two blobs with the same name, but they are different types: one is the Fan, the other is the PID Config for that Fan.  Not sure why this is necessarily \"bad\".",

My mistake 😞.\n\n\u003e Looks like a lot if not all of these are fan control related, so it is \nstrange that the config owners never noticed this while doing fan \ntesting.\n\nLooks like same name + different type is not a bug currently.\n\nAdjusted the script to provide an error when same name + same type is \nused and simply print a warning when the same name is used with a \ndifferent type.\n\nLong term i want to get rid of the cases where same name + different type is used.\n\nI don\u0027t think we need this flexibility and it complicates the EM implementation since an EM config record cannot be assumed to own the object path where its DBus interfaces are stored.\n\nPlease mark this comment as resolved in case you agree, otherwise let\u0027s discuss why we would need this capability for 2 config records to share the same object path 👍",
