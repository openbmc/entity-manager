      "message": "My current understanding of this PR is that nothing is changing re: functionality, and this just makes sure the \u0027type\u0027 interface is the last one created in this block, since d-bus sensors keys operations based on that interface being present or not.\n\nI am *assuming* that if we were going to see errors introduced by changing the order of these interfaces being added, we\u0027d see things throwing errors and breaking wholesale early-on.\n\nLooks good to me, but we\u0027ll definitely want folks with more experience here to take a look next",
