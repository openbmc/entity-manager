Do we prefer to wait for the submitter to press it themselves, or is it a \"press it if you see it\" kind of thing?\n\nLooking to make sure I\u0027m not doing anything too weird as a new reviewer on this repo :)",

      "message": "My current understanding of this PR is that nothing is changing re: functionality, and this just makes sure the \u0027type\u0027 interface is the last one created in this block, since d-bus sensors keys operations based on that interface being present or not.\n\nI am *assuming* that if we were going to see errors introduced by changing the order of these interfaces being added, we\u0027d see things throwing errors and breaking wholesale early-on.\n\nLooks good to me, but we\u0027ll definitely want folks with more experience here to take a look next",
