      "message": "Mostly, I\u0027m trying to keep the logic the same as the previous code. If `deviceIsCreated` was `true`, then `buildDevice` returns 0 and then `linkMux` runs. Similarly, if `deviceIsCreated` was `false` but `createDevice` worked, then `buildDevice` still returns 0 and `linkMux` runs. The only difference introduced is the path where `createDevice` gets tried again. So any path where the device exists at the end should run `linkMux` (according to my common sense reading of the code but I could be convinced this change is wrong).",
