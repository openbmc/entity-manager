      "message": "FYI (as a user of several thousand of these boards): Itâ€™s possible that no Board Manufacturer (nor Product Manufacturer) is defined in the device EEPROM, which would then break the probe. The issue has already been reported to ASRock Rack and was fixed in newer batches, but boards produced before the report would still need to be fixed.\n\nThat\u0027s nothing that would justify removing the `BOARD_MANUFACTURER` from the probe matching again, but it should be documented in case it affects anyone.",
