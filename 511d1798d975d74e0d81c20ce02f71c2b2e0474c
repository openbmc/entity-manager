      "message": "That surely is one possible way to do this.\n\nOriginally, there was no delay, and that worked with the supplies we originally worked with on Witherspoon. Then Rainier ended up needing a 500ms delay, that testing showed needed to be higher. I thought we could get by without the delay on some, but it is looking like a hardcoded delay of 1 second might just work.\n\nOver-engineered data-driven application design?",
