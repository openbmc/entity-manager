      "message": "This is a separate function, but not what i meant.\n\nWe try to avoid writing inline lambdas more than a few lines since `clang-format` has trouble formatting them correctly and they usually can be expressed as a separate function.\n\n(outside the function in which they are used).\n\nMaking a separate function also reduces the indentation and makes things more readable.\n\nIf you keep `writeFruByteData` as-is and make a generic `retry` function (which accepts another function as argument),\n\nthen we can `retry(std::bind_front(writeFruByteData, is16Bit, file, address, index, byteData), 3);`\n\nSo `retry` will accept any function returning `bool` and retry it `n` times until success or retry limit.\n\nThen it can return the success/failure.",
