Lets just call out the union of all the various known drive models, or do something like P4\\d\\d\\d rather than having a regex for what it\u0027s not.  I get that\u0027s \"safer\" but at some point, we need to fix this.  We can\u0027t have every drive matching PXXXX instantiating this config when it has no right to.",
