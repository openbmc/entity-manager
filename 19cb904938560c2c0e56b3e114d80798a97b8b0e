I don\u0027t know what it\u0027d take to have udev reprocess a device after it was matched to our inventory tree.   It can probably triggered with udevadm coldplug support.\nwhile it\u0027s possible probably complex.\n\nI\u0027d be ok with something that looked for the target removal and unlink the symlink and directory created and some uniquenes checking.   (is the name supposed to include something from the instance like plug location?)",
