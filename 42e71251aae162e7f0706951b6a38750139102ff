      "message": "I probably missed or am forgetting some earlier discussion on this, but are we looking at the board CCIN here for this?  why that instead of the system IM keyword?  I get that the wiring is a function of the backplane, but this does mean that if they change the CCIN of the backplane, then we need another copy of this right?  I guess it\u0027s fine, as long as in mfg they make sure the correct FRUs are plugged in.  We\u0027d run into problems either way if the vpd is messed up.",
