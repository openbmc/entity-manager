# Associations

Entity Manager will create [associations][1] between entities in certain cases.
The associations are needed as part of [2].

## Configuring Associations between Entities

The configuration record has `Name` field which is used to connect 2 ports for
an association definition.

If a matching element with `Name` is not found, that is not an error, it simply
means the component we want to associate to is not present.

The `PortType` describes which association to create. This is limited to
pre-defined values. It also defines the direction of the association.

### containing Association

Baseboard configuration.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "ContainingPort",
      "PortType": "contained_by"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "Tyan S8030 Baseboard"
}
```

Chassis configuration.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "ContainingPort",
      "PortType": "containing"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "MBX Chassis"
}
```

### powering Association

Baseboard configuration. This baseboard accepts one of several generic PSUs.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "GenericPowerPort",
      "PortType": "powered_by"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "Tyan S8030 Baseboard"
}
```

PSU configuration. This example PSU is generic and can be used on different
servers.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "GenericPowerPort",
      "PortType": "powering"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "Generic Supermicro PSU"
}
```

### cooling Association

Baseboard configuration.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "GenericCoolingPort",
      "PortType": "cooled_by"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "Tyan S8030 Baseboard"
}
```

Fan configuration.

```json
{
  "Exposes": [
    {
      "Name": "GenericCoolingPort",
      "PortType": "cooling"
      "Type": "Port"
    }
  ],
  "Name": "Generic Fan"
}
```
