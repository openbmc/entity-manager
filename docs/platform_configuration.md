# Platform Configurations

## Overview

Platform configurations are a special category of entity-manager configurations
used to detect a **platform** (as opposed to a single entity) by detecting 2 or
more entities.

**Key Characteristics**:

1. Platform configurations detect 2 or more entities to identify a platform
2. As of this writing, they are not validated by a schema during the build
   process

They allow exposing configuration that can't be described against a single
entity. One example is configuration for MCTP over USB networks, which can
involve multiple USB hubs across entities.

## Location

Platform-specific configurations are stored in:

```
platform_configurations/<vendor>/
```
