      "message": "This modification is a special case. The EE team requires a new fan board, and this new fan board needs a new formula to calculate the sensor voltage value. However, the old fan board cannot apply this formula. Therefore, we have to probe it twice based on the different AM4 values.\nAdditionally, if we don\u0027t explicitly reference bus 16/17 in the probe statement, it\u0027s likely that bus 16/17 may not consistently correspond to fan 0/1 when probing the fan board. If my understanding is incorrect, please feel free to let me know, thank you.",
