      "message": "As it stands this is used to associate the the `Transport` value to the interface name, so that the reactor implementation knows how to encode the `Address` value from the `MCTPDevice` schema for the call to `mctpd`\u0027s `SetupEndpoint`. That was a rationalisation to avoid specifying `Transport` in the `MCTPDevice` schema, as it\u0027s implied by the interface the device can be reached through. However, in the future the `MCTPInterface` schema could specify properties such as `MTU` and `BusOwner` to define behaviours for management of the associated MCTP networks, along with their instantiation. At the moment we still rely on the `mctp-local` systemd target for both. Generally a script is run in that target to configure the interfaces, but it has no tie-in to the platform configuration logic of EM.",

      "message": "It felt more meaningful at the time, but I\u0027m not too fussed. There\u0027s probably a discussion to be had about whether static endpoint IDs should be assigned or assumed configured into the device, and whether we need `mctpd`\u0027s `AssignEndpointStatic` vs just `LearnEndpoint`. Some indication needs to be given to the reactor though - it needs to pick whether to issue `SetupEndpoint` or `LearnEndpoint` (or `AssignEndpointStatic`).\n\nThose D-Bus methods are documented here:\n\nhttps://github.com/CodeConstruct/mctp/blob/main/docs/mctpd.md",
