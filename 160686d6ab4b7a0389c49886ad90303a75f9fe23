      "message": "The design with the physical topology entries is that a board could have all sorts of different ports on it, like PS port, riser port, BMC card port, etc.\n\n(docs are: https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/docs/associations.md,  https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/physical-topology.md).\n\nSo far it\u0027s hardly used though, people may not be interested in all the associations needed for Redfish yet.\n\nthe code at https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/src/topology.cpp#L38 just needs the upstream side to end in \u0027Port\u0027, so maybe this can be an enum with just 1 entry now?  Does that conflict with the the enumerating of the Type field in your other commit?",
