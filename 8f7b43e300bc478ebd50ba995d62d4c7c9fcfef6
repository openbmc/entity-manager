      "message": "On line 4 it is \"USB Port\" and in the file name as well,\nbut the description says it\u0027s a \"serial port\".\n\nIs it a serial port exposed via a USB interface?\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, maybe we should adjust the name of this schema, Type and filename to match.\n\nSomething like\n```USBSerialPort``` ?\n\n\nHowever modbus serial line protocol does not require a USB device, right?\n\nMaybe it can just be\n```\nSerialPort\n```\nor\n```\nModbusSerialPort\n```",
