Depending on the hardware design and intended application, even a single component will run with different thresholds in different systems. Same story for ```PowerState``` and other properties.",

      "message": "\u003e If you have any constructive idea about the notation, i am happy to consider 😊\n\nTelling me to limit my feedback only to the thing you\u0027ve proposed is a little offputting, which is why i didn\u0027t reply right away.  The goal here is a system that  works well, not a couple config files that are easy to read.  At a system level, i don\u0027t see where these fix in between code modification, bind expressions, and explicitly stating each thing.  If this is something you want to continue with, that would be my constructive advise, define the need in terms other than deduplicating the config.",
