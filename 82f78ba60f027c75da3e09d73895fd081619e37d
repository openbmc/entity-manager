If you detected a chassis with 4 fans, it has 4 fans. If you detected a chassis with 3 fans, it has 3 fans.\n\nWhat if it matches neither chassis, or doesn\u0027t have a chassis?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Detecting one thing and then un-detecting it via another config seems misguided and the config is broken. We should detect the presence of things and not pretend something is there just to cancel it out via another config.\n\nI can tell you that the intent works quite well, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d call it \"broken\".  the goal is\n\n1. The motherboard declares fan headers\n2. The chassis declares fans\n\nif no chassis is found, all the fan headers are enabled.  If a chassis is found, only the expected fan headers are enabled.  I have personally found this behavior useful, but I haven\u0027t no used it in several years.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Just make 2 configs.

Just because it\u0027s not used by you, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s used by nobody.  Proving that nobody uses a feature is difficult, and especially for a small feature like this, isn\u0027t worth the maintenance effort to break by removal.  If we break it on accident, so be it, someone can send us the fix, but if we remove the feature entirely, it can prevent people upgrading that relied on it.\n\n\u003e from the community code. As per the above reasoning there is no need for the feature and the use-case can be accomplished with 2 separate configs for the chassis variants.\n\nWe disagree that this can be solved with 2 configs.  We also disagree that \"there is no need\".\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e It could be there are people using this feature and we don\u0027t know about it.\n\u003e \n\u003e I had a search through entire github \n\u003e \n\u003e https://github.com/search?q\u003d%2F%28%3F-i%29%22DisableNode%22%2F+path%3A*.json\u0026type\u003dcode\u0026p\u003d2\n\u003e \n\u003e and there is no usage of this feature. We can speculate about hypothetical usage in private forks but with that mindset we will never be able to remove any feature, ever.\n\nIn my opinion you still haven\u0027t overcome the bar for \"we should remove this\", and considering I maintain this code, the maintenance burden partially falls on me.  I believe that randomly removing features based on a github search will be a larger maintenance burden than keeping them.\n\nIf this feature is preventing you from implementing something, I\u0027m happy to have a technical discussion there about how to accomplish that, but the justification that nobody uses it therefore it\u0027s worth the effort to review and delete, I don\u0027t agree with.",
