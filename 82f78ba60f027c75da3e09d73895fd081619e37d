      "message": "\u003e As an example, it lets you disable the \"fan4\" port, if you detect a chassis that only has 3 fans.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how that would work. If you detected a chassis with 4 fans, it has 4 fans. If you detected a chassis with 3 fans, it has 3 fans.\n\nDetecting one thing and then un-detecting it via another config seems misguided and the config is broken. We should detect the presence of things and not pretend something is there just to cancel it out via another config.\n\nJust make 2 configs. One is the chassis config with 3 fans, another config for the chassis with 4 fans. Alternatively detect the fans as part of their own config.\n\n\u003e Lets get some justification for why we want to remove it,\n\nIn my book any unused feature is fair game to remove from the community code. As per the above reasoning there is no need for the feature and the use-case can be accomplished with 2 separate configs for the chassis variants.\n\n\u003e It could be there are people using this feature and we don\u0027t know about it.\n\nI had a search through entire github \n\nhttps://github.com/search?q\u003d%2F%28%3F-i%29%22DisableNode%22%2F+path%3A*.json\u0026type\u003dcode\u0026p\u003d2\n\nand there is no usage of this feature. We can speculate about hypothetical usage in private forks but with that mindset we will never be able to remove any feature, ever.",
