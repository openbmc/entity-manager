Pretty much single contributor since 2022 has been someone relatively active in the community.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/williamspatrick/42361153a246bd5a11ef2aa3874a5692\n\n\u003e This breaks the intent of EM. If we can just hardcode a compatible interface, there\u0027s no need for it to be in an exposes record. Just put it in code.\n\nI don\u0027t understand what you\u0027ve written here.\n\nThe purpose of this record is to say \"this FRU has a firmware blob that can be updated and the update image needs to be \u0027Compatible\u0027 in this way\".  How do we \"just put that in code\"?  This seems to be exactly what EM configurations are for.\n\n\u003e So if there\u0027s a description for CompatibleName that can be put here, lets put it here, and not bound in on dbus definitions. They might match, and that\u0027s fine, but if this is an enumeration, it needs to be called out as such, and describe how folks can configure it.\n\nCan you elaborate on what action you\u0027d like to see here; is it just a change of the description?\n\nThere is `xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Compatible` where the intended design is for someone to define an empty dbus interface with enumerations, which become the valid values of a possible Compatible.  You can see some existing ones here: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/3eb0180161fc42a91fd2197f60695da1541e8083/yaml/com/meta/Hardware/BMC.interface.yaml#L17\n\n(These are already used as part of the BMC update identifiers: https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/88c1c16b4583b1b2bd890dcacaa22290b940fc82/meta-facebook/meta-yosemite4/conf/machine/yosemite4.conf#L9 )\n\nThere was a question on how this is suppose to work on Discord also, so I must have done a poor job of documenting it.  https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/867820390406422538/1317152417564987432\n\nI don\u0027t know how we reconcile the \"this needs to be simple enough that people who don\u0027t understand OpenBMC can configure it\" with \"we need to ensure these are unique and documented so they can be reasoned about\".  I know at one point someone suggested using device-tree style naming (ie. \"meta,yosemite4\") but those are similarly understood only by people who understand kernel device trees.  Using reverse-DNS style is pretty widely used all over industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation#Examples) and seems pretty straight-forward to understand to me (plus it aligns with all our dbus stuff).\n\nWe could require people to add to a big list of valid compatibles in EM so you could use the short name (ie. \"Yosemite4\") but that seems like extra steps for the same effect and it doesn\u0027t allow us to handle two companies ending up with the same code-name / model-name for two different products.",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t about a system, but a device.  Anyhow...\n\nThe design suggests that we need both of them as a PLDM image identifier, which is the purpose of this configuration.  The reason is because we\u0027d like to be able to differentiate (and block as necessary) two different images that work functionally on the same hardware but have not been qualified in different environments.\n\nFor an example I made up on the fly, we could have a different compatible of `com.meta.Hardware.Yosemite4.CX7` vs `com.meta.Hardware.Catalina.CX7` and ensure that the image that was qualified for Yv4 is never applied to Catalina, even thought it is the same hardware.\n\n(What I wrote above actually doesn\u0027t work today because the CX7 would have the \"Compatible\" and there isn\u0027t currently a way to tweak them per-machine; we might work on that next half.  We do have concrete cases of the same CPLD being used for different purposes and so while the VendorIANA would be the same we need to have different compatible identifiers so we don\u0027t end up putting one CPLD image on a different [purpose] CPLD and brick the whole device.)",
